# @althar/desktop

Althar's desktop app: Electron, with the runtime in a utility process and the interface in the window. It opens a folder as a project, where you talk to the project's coordinator: it answers questions about the code and turns what you want changed into tasks. Each task shows in the conversation as a card: first its plan (who implements it, who reviews it), which starts on its own after 25 seconds unless you change or hold it, then where it stands. A task's own thread shows what the lead did, folded once each turn is over, with what each step reported: the lead's summary, and the review's findings. You talk to the lead from the composer, interrupt it, change its model, hand the task to another agent, or stop it. You can also plan a task yourself.

It is step 3 of the [MVP plan](../../docs/plans/mvp.md): the coordinator loop.

## Use it

```bash
bun run dev
```

That builds the app and opens it. Agents sign in with their own tools first (`claude auth login`, `codex login`, `opencode auth login`); the start screen shows which are ready.

The app shares its profile and worktrees with the command-line client (`apps/cli`), so both see the same projects. One runtime at a time can use a profile, so close one before opening the other.

| Environment | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `ALTHAR_PROFILE` | `~/Library/Application Support/Althar` on macOS |
| `ALTHAR_WORKTREES` | `~/Althar` |
| `ALTHAR_FAKE_AGENTS=1` | Off. Runs the scripted fake agent under Claude Code's and Codex's names, and a fake GitHub at `https://github.test`, keeping tokens in memory rather than the Keychain, for the end-to-end tests. Packaged builds leave it out |
| `ALTHAR_FAKE_REMOTE` | None. With the fakes, the bare repository that pushes to the fake GitHub land in |
| `ALTHAR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `ALTHAR_GITLAB_CLIENT_ID`, `ALTHAR_LINEAR_CLIENT_ID` | None. The public ids of Althar's apps on those services, for signing in through the browser; without one, the service takes a pasted token |

## Work on it

From `apps/desktop`:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run build` | Builds the main process, the runtime, the preload and the window into `dist/` |
| `bun run build:package` | The same, without the end-to-end tests' hooks, as a packaged app will be built |
| `bun run start` | Opens what was last built |
| `bun run check` | Format, type-aware lint and type checks |
| `bun run test` | The window's view models and views against a fake client, and its client against the real runtime |
| `bun run test:coverage` | The same, with the coverage gate: 90% of lines and branches |
| `bun run test:e2e` | Builds the app and drives it with Playwright, with the fake agent: a project, a task, a thread, a call answered, and the runtime crashing and coming back; and, with the fake GitHub, connecting it and a task ending in a draft pull request |
| `bun run verify` | Check, coverage and the end-to-end tests, as CI runs them |

To run the end-to-end test against a real agent, signed in on this machine (it uses a little of its usage):

```bash
ALTHAR_REAL_AGENT=claude-code bunx playwright test e2e/real.spec.ts
```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for how it is put together.
